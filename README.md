# Ws-1

A simple educational project to understand and explore WebSocket technology.

## Overview

This project serves as a learning exercise for WebSocket implementation with:
- Server: Node.js with Express and ws library
- Client: React application

## Project Structure

- `/server` - Basic WebSocket server implementation demonstrating core concepts
- `/client` - React client showing how to establish and use WebSocket connections

## Learning Concepts

- Understanding the WebSocket protocol and its advantages
- Setting up bidirectional communication channels
- Handling WebSocket events and message passing
- Implementing real-time data transfer between server and client

## Getting Started

### Server
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```
The server will run on port 8080.

### Client
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Once both server and client are running, you can explore WebSocket functionality through the interface and observe real-time data transmission between client and server.
